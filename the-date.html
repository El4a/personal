      <h1>The Date</h1>
<p>I quicken my step as I navigate the darkening streets. The equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence; all day the wind had howled through the streets and the rain had beaten against the windows. I set out during, what’s turning out to be, a very short period of relief. Seeing the first foreboding raindrops – deceptively gentle – making patterns on my coat, I hasten to reach my destination. I don’t want to be late for this date. </p>
<i>I can’t believe you’re going on a date again. It never works out right. Stop expecting another to make you happy. </i>
<p>That’s not what I do.</p>
<i>Always searching for that bit of dopamine-inducing validation.</i>
<p>It will be different this time.</p>
<i>No it won’t.</i>
<p>I want to say I just shrug away the thoughts but I know I don’t. I just press them down, where they settle in swimmingly with all the other ones, organising a brunch to discuss all my flaws, failures and fuckups. The three F’s. I’m not sure why I’ve agreed to this date. Perhaps because he’s been a familiar face for a while now; often showing up on my worst days and offering silent comfort, understanding, and solutions – although usually too drastic for my taste. And yes, there have been some flirtations. However, I’ve never dared to take the next step, merely resigned myself to tethering on the edge, tense for the jump but ultimately talking myself out of it. After these last few horrible days however, I felt ready for anything that would distract me.</p>
<i>Pathetic.</i>
<p>Taking a deep breath, I mentally chant my mantra: be chill, be cool, be fun. </p>
<i>You know you won’t be. You’ll be nervous and anxious and boring.</i>
<p>I try to smooth down my thoughts as I reach for the bell.</p>

<p>The buzzer is barely audible above the wind boxing my ears, producing a strained ebbing sound. The hallway beyond is dim. I take a few tentative steps, hoping some automatic light switch will trigger, but the corridor remains obstinately dark. A thin, vertical strip of white light at the other end is my only guidance. Assuming that’s the elevator, I make my way towards it, prodding the floor ahead of me apprehensively with a foot at each step, to make sure I don’t tumble down some unexpected steps. The light spills out when the doors slide open, flooding the hallway and temporarily blinding me. The elevator mirror taunts me as I try to rearrange my dishevelled hair. I scrutinise my image through narrowed eyes. I look very windswept but still presentable I’d say.</p>
<i>Your nose is unattractive red and your lips are peeling. Should’ve brought chapstick.</i>
<p>I search my purse for chapstick but I didn’t bring it with me.</p>
<i>Classic you.</i>
<p>The elevator comes to a bumping halt and the doors slide open silently to reveal another light-averse hallway. This time my guide is a horizontal strip of white light, to shake things up, protruding from below the door at the far end, beckoning me closer. I can’t read any apartment numbers, and frankly I can’t even discern any other doors on this floor at all. But it’s no matter, instinctively I feel a pull towards that door.</p>
<p>I hesitate before knocking. I’m all of a sudden aware of how tired I am, unsure if I’m willing to do this again. Meeting people is such a mentally taxing event. I enjoy adding fresh contacts to the plethora of social acquaintances I have but after a while, it does leave you unfulfilled. It’s a form of social malnutrition in which you cram yourself with sugary smalltalk which, no matter how much you consume, will always be a poorly nutritional substitute for fruit and vegetables. I’m so weary of asking and answering the same questions over and over again, never penetrating any deeper layer of what it means to connect with another human being; of the conversations in which everyone is talking but nobody is listening, simply overlaying disconnected narratives, building upon the anecdotes of others to tell your own story and waiting for a gap in the conversation to fill, until everyone just runs out of things to say. I am so frustrated with how long it takes to get to know someone—spending too much time chatting in their psychological entryway about the safe and shallow things they allow the whole world to see – while I wish I could dive into their core-being; discovering their deepest, most intimate thoughts and desires from the onset of acquaintance and using those answers as the indelible foundation of the image I create of them, before easing into casualness and asking them about things to fill some small gaps here and there, like where they’re from, and what they do for a living.</p>
<i>Gods, just knock already for fuck’s sake.</i>
<p>As I raise my hand, the door swings open abruptly. He greets me with a dazzling smile and invites me in with a wide sweeping motion, which somehow seems to create a draft of air, giving me a light push forward at the small of my back. “I thought I heard someone ambling on the landing,” he says amiably. His voice is soothing, his presence calming, and yet I can’t help but dither and emit some incoherent sounds – which need a lot of goodwill to be considered a language known to mankind. He graciously ignores it and ushers me further in.</p>  
<p>He talks to me in a continuous stream of pleasantries while moving around the place, fulfilling his host duties. I don’t register most of what he says, instead listening to the melodic timbre of his voice and making the appropriate conversational noises. My eyes wander around the apartment, idly picking up and replacing knickknacks on the bookshelves. I read the titles on the spines of the books, most I don’t understand; I turned the date on an elaborately decorated calendar, only to find it ends on today. When I point it out to him, he just smiles and says it might be a printing mistake. The place resonates weirdly with me. I haven’t been here and yet it feels familiar, comfortable. At the same time, it feels overwhelming and dangerous, but also hollow and devoid of anything. Like a deep chasm where the danger is the empty void filling it. The swirling thoughts constrict my throat and I’m suddenly very conscious of my heartbeat. </p>
<i>Is this one of your anxiety attacks again? Is this what we’re doing tonight?</i>
<p>I step outside on the balcony, expecting to be buffeted by the winds, but this high up it’s strangely quiet, as if I have risen above the turmoils that harass us all in daily life. Taking a deep breath, my lungs fill with cold air. In the distance sounds the half-forlorn, half-escapist whistle of a train about to leave. The squeak of the sliding door behind me announces his arrival, holding two well-filled wine glasses. The wine glistens a deep red. He presses one in my hand, his fingers grazing mine in the transference. The heat radiating off his skin creates a bubble of warmth around him. I edge closer to bask in it. He looks at me – silent, but so very present, the way I know him from previous flirtations. Despite the unstirring air, an ethereal zephyr ruffles his hair. He softly strokes my cheek and despite the warmness of his touch, it sends a chill through me which makes me instinctively recoil. He’s not offended. He just smiles his understanding smile and retreats a little – creating a physical and mental space, telling me he won't take me. Instead, it’s up to me to bridge it, if I want to.</p>
<p>We re-enter the apartment and now I notice it’s as cold inside as outside, the only source of heat seems to be him.
We talk, really talk, and the cold is soon forgotten. I find my own sentiments reflected in him; we talk about how most of life is forgotten instantly, almost as it’s happening. The days following each other rapidly, slipping through our fingers and dissolving into oblivion before you even had time to register they happened. The routine of living, creating featureless stretches between one memory and the next. The unspoken words form a secret language between us – that, once revealed, is gone forever. I feel understood, without any fear of judgement. It has been so long since I relaxed like this, free from worry and anxiousness. I sink deeper into the couch, not sure I’d be able to get up at this point. It’s so comfortable and peaceful. Streaks of moonlight dapple the shadows of the room, dissolving before touching the ground. Music is playing; congenial but devoid of any vivaciousness. It’s making me a bit drowsy. I try to get up but my skin seems glued down. Giving up the struggle, I lean back with a sigh, promptly sinking deeper into the cushions. I smile lazily. It’s pleasant enough.</p>
<p>He inches closer to me. “What are you thinking?” he asks inquisitively.
“Everything and nothing. Thoughts from the spinal cord.” He looks at me quizzically, “Where did you hear that?”
“I’m not sure, I don’t remember,” I yawn. “I think I read it somewhere.” I find it difficult to speak.</p>
<i>Are you slurring?</i>
<p>The air seems to have heated up. I can’t feel the cold anymore. Which is nice. Toasty. But it’s also getting dense. I’m struggling to breath a bit; the air feels heavy and oppressive around me. I ask to open a window. He doesn’t seem to hear me, but just looks at me, softly stroking my hand. His touch feels good. I don’t recoil anymore. I want to be cradled in his arms until I fade away. The edges of the room seem to darken and shrink, until all I can see is his face, looking, waiting. Do I want him to kiss me? Yes…, yes, I think so. He can read me. “A goodnight kiss?” he asks softly. He lets me bridge the gap he made earlier. I’m very close now. I reach out and touch his skin. It’s no longer soft. It’s hard and smooth, like marble. His eyes invite me, they’re kind but strangely detached. I reach out with everything I have, pour all my emotions, my life, everything that makes me human into it. But it makes no connection. I only see oblivion reflected in his eyes. His handsome, marble features become translucent in the moonlight, underneath I glimpse the void waiting for me, my end.</p>
<p>Death is seducing me.</p>
<p>I try to move but he holds my hand in an iron grip. He doesn’t need to squeeze or exert effort, he is as immovable as a statue, dispassionately observing me. I’m flailing weakly and ineffectively, tears stinging my eyes. I plead. It’s not my time to go. It can't be. He smiles indulgently and explains, as if talking to a child: “You chose this date,” nodding towards the beautiful calendar on the bookshelf. I look into his eyes, expecting evil to stare back at me, but there is none to be found. There is only a coldness, an uncaring cruelty. Like any wild thing, like a force of nature. Like the torrents outside gathering themselves into a devastating storm, ripping out trees and crashing them fiercely on the houses. The storm isn’t evil, it’s cruel; it acts according to its nature.</p>
<p>I hear his voice whispering around me. “Why should you resist? Why should you fight? Everything is rendered meaningless in the end, nullified by death. Acceptance is release.” He’s right of course, and yet I continue the struggle, more invigorated than before. Because that is all that’s left to me. I twist and pull, scream and heave, but there is no breaking his deathly grip. I slump down, all furious revolt replaced by a vast despondency. It’s too late, I jumped. The irony of it all is not lost on me; I only struggled when it was too late. And I even enjoyed it. It makes me chuckle out loud. He is startled by that. I look up and bore my eyes in his’.</p>
<p>And laugh.</p>
