    <p class="intro">
      First things first: please refrain from judging me based on this website. I threw it together on a sunny,
      I-should-be-outside-afternoon, after it had been on my to-do list for the past half decade. So, now that I have
      finially carved out my little treasuretrove of internet presence, let's get to it.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      Like everyone else and their aunties, I have recently discovered the digital nomad life. I'm currently enjoying
      this privilege travelling around Europe, working as a UX/UI/Interaction expert/consultant (pick whichever title
      you find most appealing) for a Belgium based company.
    </p>

    <h2>What I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">want</span> would like</h2>
    <p>
      Being a remote worker is the best thing since slice bread. Honestly, even better because sliced bread really isn’t
      all that it’s hyped up to be. That means for me, to be a happy and fulfilled human being, this is something I will
      not (easily) relinquish. </p>
    <p>If I could combine this with some more exciting projects than I’ve had so far, that would be wonderful. Ideally
      (but not exclusively limited to) something game-related; specifically genres like visual storytelling, interactive
      choose-your-own-adventure games, or narrative-driven RPG’s.

    </p>
    <h2>What I can do</h2>
    <p>I have 6 years of experience designing enterprise applications, dealing with heaps of stakeholders & analysts (some better, some worse), code reviewing teammates, processing user feedback and searching for compromises. I have excellent HTML/CSS skills (again: not demo'd anywhere in this code), a good understanding of javascript, Sketch/Figma knowledge, experience (albeit a tad outdated) with Angular and Vue, and the well-developed ability to google everything else. 
      <br><br>
      I have been writing for a while, but only now (slowing) making tangible samples. I think my natural writing voice leans towards a brisk, easily digestible style, that can be both whimsical and playful, as well as morose and melancholic. I usually suffer tremendously from imposter-syndrome, but in this case I will state with trembling confidence: me good writer, me make great word-strings, even though I can't back it up yet.</p>

    <h2>What I'm still learning</h2>
    <p>There is a huge gaping hole in my knowledge concerning the technical aspects of writing and an utter lack of experience working in a team (of writers). The former I'm trying to rectify by reading stuff, the latter I can't learn from books. I've also started with some unity tutorials, thinking that could nicely combine my technical background with my storytelling interests. </p>


    <h2>Why you want me (warning: presumptuous)</h2>
    <p>Like everyone, I sport some flaws that I wil put somewhere in a tiny footnote, however, I want
      to illustrate my incredible capacity for being enthusiastic, driven, and motivated when things interest me. I strive for perfection, and especially when things just don't <i>feel</i> right, I tend to keep tweaking until they do. Since I'm a nomad, I can move around easily and make sure I'm always in a timezone that matches the rest of the team.</p>

    <p>Bottom line: I'm fun, flexible, and I care about my work.</p>
