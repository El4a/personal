    <p class="intro">
     First things first: please refrain from judging me based on this website. I threw it together on a sunny, I-should-be-outside-afternoon, after it had been on my to-do list for the past half decade. So, now that I have finially carved out my little treasuretrove of internet presence, let's get to it.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      Like everyone else and their aunties, I have recently discovered the digital nomad life. I'm currently enjoying this privilege travelling around Europe, working as a UX/UI/Interaction expert/consultant (pick whichever title you find most appealing) for a Belgium based company. 
    </p>

    <h2>What I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">want</span> would like</h2>
    <p>
Being a remote worker is the best thing since slice bread. Honestly, even better because sliced bread really isn’t all that it’s hyped up to be. That means for me, to be a happy and fulfilled human being, this is something I will not (easily) relinquish. </p>
<p>If I could combine this with some more exciting projects than I’ve had so far, that would be wonderful. Ideally (but not exclusively limited to) something game-related; specifically genres like visual storytelling, interactive choose-your-own-adventure games, or narrative-driven RPG’s. 

    </p>
    <h2>What I can do</h2>
    <p>I have 6 years of experience designing enterprise applications, dealing with heaps of stakeholders & analysts (some better, some worse), code reviewing teammates, processing user feedback and searching for compromises.</p>

    <h2>What I'm still learning</h2>
    <p>I've started with some unity tutorials and would like to progress a bit further. Also, learning not to take criticism too personal. Although Jessica from HR telling me not to take a third piece of cake was definitely gaslighting me, no matter how much she tries to convince me she was just making sure there was enough for everyone. Don't shoot the bull Jessica, you know what you did.</p>


    <h2>Why you want me (presumptuous)</h2>
    <p>In my early teens I had teachers taking me to the side and saying: 
      <div>"Charlie, you are so obtuse and difficult when you are not interested in something. Your attitude influences your classmates."</div>
      <br>
      <div>Me: *disinterested, teenage shrug*</div>
      <br>
      Them (sighing): Why can't you bring up a percentage of the enthusiasm you have when you <i>are</i> interested?
    </p>
    <p>They were right and I pity them for having me in their boring classes like calculus and french. However, I want to illustrate my incredible capacity for being enthusiastic, driven, and motivated when things do suit me. I will carry projects and drag, kick, beguile, or lure co-workers into it. They will stand around the coffee machine, questioning their own decisions, filled with a sense of wonder. </p>

    <p>I'm fun, flexible, and I care about my work.</p>
