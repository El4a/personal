      <h1>Cherimoya aka Anona aka Custard Apple</h1>
      <p>"Watch out for the seeds," he warned me, just as my teeth almost crushed the hard shell of a pit, "they're
        poisonous." "Excellent," I think to myself. I always do appreciate a sense of danger while engaging in the
        exhilarating act of consuming the recommended daily intake of fruit & veggies.</p>
        <p>
        I am currently occupied with discovering some local delicacy I have even never heard of before: the enigmatic
        Cherimoya, also known as the Custard Apple. Its dragonscale-like appearance being what compelled me into
        picking it up in the first place, I'm quickly inundated with promises of it being The Best Fruit in the world.
        "Better than pineapples!" the encouraging stall-owner vows to me.
        </p>
         <p>
        Always eager to find something even better than pineapples, I dig in happily. Mere moments later, frustration is
        already building as I, ever more strained, delve through the soft white flesh of the "apple". The main
        difference with the apple we all know and love  – apart from its flavour, texture, acidity and basically
        everything else but its shape – is that an apple (god bless) has a nice, concise core containing all the seeds,
        packaged in a convenient way for you to get rid of. Clearly, the Cherimoya has decisively gone another route.
        </p>
        <p>
        My fingers pry apart the, increasingly mushy, contents in a despairing flurry of irate movements, sifting
        through the pitiful remnants for edible, poison-free, pieces. More and more chucks of the sweet goodness get
        tossed out with the seeds, the limits of my patience in sight. The proverbial baby and the bathwater story.
        Popping another part in my mouth and yet again have my anxious probing teeth graze against the ominous cracking
        seeds, I absentmindedly start to wonder: how poisonous are these things <i style="font-style:italic">really</i>? Surely, one can just risk it.
        </p>
        <p>
        The moment where I realise my desire for life is less potent than my eagerness for easy accessible food, is the
        moment I decide the cherimoya isn't that great. Turns out I prefer a pineapple, which, after all, possesses the
        appeasing quality of not holding certain death.</p>
